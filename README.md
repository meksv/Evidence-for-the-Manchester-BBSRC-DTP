This branch is tailored to the 'Bioinformatics' section of the personal statement. 

The 'Bioinformatics with BioPython' and 'Bioinformatics with Biotite' code examples are a part of my re-training in coding. Code was written by myself with guidance from a Udemy course and made unique by changing variables, code layout, graph formats and using different biological sequences for analysis. 

The other examples are my bioinformatic internship and courseworks I completed during my degree.
